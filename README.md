# RL-SelfDriving-project-using-CARLA-
A project to create an RL model using CARLA and Deep Learning. 

Step1: Create a virtual environment
Step2: Install the dependencies from the requirements.txt file
Step3: Install Carla 13.0
Step4: Check the necessary directory paths and update them (inside the .py files)
Step5: Train the CNN model from trainCNNmodel.py
Step6: Train the RL model from train.py
Step7: Test the model from test.py
